# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Problem Statement

X Education, an online education company, is facing challenges with lead conversion. Despite acquiring a significant number of leads, their conversion rate is only around 30%. They want to improve this rate by identifying the most promising leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads.' The company has appointed you to build a model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of conversion, helping the sales team prioritize leads effectively.

## Data

Have been provided with a dataset containing around 9000 leads. The dataset includes various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc., and the target variable 'Converted,' which indicates whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). Additionally, some categorical variables contain a level called 'Select,' which should be treated as a null value.

## Goals

Build a Logistic Regression Model: Develop a logistic regression model to assign lead scores. This score will be used to identify potential leads. A higher score implies a greater likelihood of conversion, aligning with the company's goal of achieving an 80% conversion rate.
Handle Categorical Variables: Address the issue of 'Select' values in categorical variables as they are equivalent to null values.
Adjust to Future Requirements: Ensure that the model can adapt to potential changes or problems presented by the company in the future.
